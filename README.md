## About The Project

![FAERIE Architecture][faerie-architecture]


F.A.E.R.I.E. aims to make knowledge transfer to new staff seamless by empowering them with a tool to quickly retrieve information from their organization's knowledge base.

What is F.A.E.R.I.E.?

- Fully Autonomous Engine for Rapid Information Extraction; 
- A fully autonomous engine; Unlike your typical GenAI powered chat bot, it will reason with itself. Reducing the need for human guidance, One question --> One Answer with no hallucinations; We hope...
- Rapid information extraction; Unlike your typical search engine, you won't need additional prompting to find the information you need. Ask a question --> You get the answer quickly; That's the goal at least...
